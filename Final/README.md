# Customer Mangement System

The purpose of this project is to create an application for managing customer information to improve the efficiency of information management in the company.
The scope of this project includes adding, removing, updating, and viewing for customer information.

## Setup

Run the Main.java file (INFO5100/Final/src/main/java/Main.java).
This system stores data in the file called customerList.txt (INFO5100/Final/customerList.txt).
If customerList.txt does not exist, the system will automatically create a customerList.txt file after the user runs the system method.
